# GUIProjects
Miscellaneous GUI projects, mostly for fun or specialty use in software development. Each project builds to a Mac executible and an executable jar file.
### (Icon Notes)
Icons may be converted at AnyConv.com, or using the Graphics Converter. The Converter file types are listed alphabetically, but you won't find the .icns files under I, but under Apple.

## Amazing
My friend Wolf McNalley introduced me to Labyrinths, like the on drawn on the floor of the Cathedral at Chartes. That labyrinth has four axes, and Wolf showed
me one he came up with that had five axes. After giving it some thought, I wrote this tool to generate a labyrinth with any number of axes. (It takes a long time,
even on today's machines, to create one with more than a hundres axes.)

## Anagram
This fun tool is for anagram lovers. Given an anagram, it helps you solve it by removing letters from the anagram when you type them in the solution field, and 
prevents you from typing letters that aren't allowed.

## CValues
If you have some unfamiliar text and want to know the unicode values of the characters, paste them in here, and it will show you the hex values. This is useful
for debugging strange copy/paste operations.

## Escape
Shows the unicode escape values of any text, and translates between readable text and Java unicode escape sequences.

## QuordleAid
This helps me solve [Quardle](URL "https://www.quordle.com/#/") puzzles. It also helps with [Wordle](URL "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html").
