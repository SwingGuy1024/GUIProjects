# Beat Counter
BeatCounter helps me count the beats per minute in a song for my playlists of dance music. (This is most helpful for social dances like Lindy Hop, Foxtrot, or Tango.)

To use, just tap the space bar to the beat of the song. After about three beats, a dial will appear showing how many beats per minute the song is using. It will adjust automatically as the speed of the song changes.

Once you stop, it will copy the beats-per-minute onto the clipboard, so you can paste it into iTunes or whatever app you use for your playlists.
